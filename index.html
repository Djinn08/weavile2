        Weavile, the Pickpocket Pokemon
    </h1>
    <p>
        Weavile is a bipedal Pokémon with a pale, gray body that resembles both a cat and a weasel. It has a bright red crown and collar made of wide feathers and a single, thinner feather on each ear. The ear feathers are smaller on a female Weavile. Weavile has two tail feathers and three claws on each paw. There is an oval, yellow gem-like protrusion in the center of its forehead. Its eyes are red with three eyelashes, and four fangs protrude from its upper jaw.

Weavile live in snow-covered areas and are notorious predators. Weavile is famed for its speed and agility. Weavile is also known for its intelligence and cunning nature, thanks to its brain having developed as it evolves from <a href='#'>Sneasel</a>. A scratch from Weavile's sharp claws can cause frostbite. Weavile travel in packs of four or five, with one of them acting as the pack leader. They hunt for prey such as <a href='#'> Alolan Sandshrew</a>, <a href='#'> Alolan Vulpix</a>, and even larger species like <a href='#'> Mamoswine</a>, then divide up the prey amongst themselves. Weavile can communicate with each other by carving patterns into trees, ice, and boulders, with over 500 distinct signs recorded.

        Evolution Requirements
    </h2>
    <p>
        Weavile can only be evolved from  from its prior evolution SNEASEL by holding an item known as a QUICKCLAW and this has to be done during the night.

    The dangers and possible risks

<h4>Something to note: Weavile and its predecessors are exceedingly fast - if sighted, try to let others know.

    The attacks that a Weavile may use for hunting or defense are as follows:

            Prepares by lowering its body temperature and using aforementioned energy manipulation to shoot a below
            sub zero temperature beam of pure ice.
            This can be made comparable to the temperatures found on that of -357 C*.

    While not recorded due to low number of witnesses - They will also use other tactics such as manipulation like Fake Tears, boost their speed by using agility and or Evasion - a move that can create “Clones” but has been confirmed to be afterimages of just one singular entity.
With the aforementioned tactics Weavile will use its cunning to steal items from humans when possible - it is not known what they do with these items but it has become infamous enough to be dubbed the “Pickpocket Pokemon”. Anyone with one of these Pokemon as a companion may be subject to scrutiny due to their naturally fowl nature.
