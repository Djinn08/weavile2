        Weavile, the Pickpocket Pokemon
    </h1>
    <p>
        Weavile is a bipedal Pok√©mon with a pale, gray body that resembles both a cat and a weasel. It has a bright red crown and collar made of wide feathers and a single, thinner feather on each ear. The ear feathers are smaller on a female Weavile. Weavile has two tail feathers and three claws on each paw. There is an oval, yellow gem-like protrusion in the center of its forehead. Its eyes are red with three eyelashes, and four fangs protrude from its upper jaw.

Weavile live in snow-covered areas and are notorious predators. Weavile is famed for its speed and agility. Weavile is also known for its intelligence and cunning nature, thanks to its brain having developed as it evolves from <a href='#'>Sneasel</a>. A scratch from Weavile's sharp claws can cause frostbite. Weavile travel in packs of four or five, with one of them acting as the pack leader. They hunt for prey such as <a href='#'> Alolan Sandshrew</a>, <a href='#'> Alolan Vulpix</a>, and even larger species like <a href='#'> Mamoswine</a>, then divide up the prey amongst themselves. Weavile can communicate with each other by carving patterns into trees, ice, and boulders, with over 500 distinct signs recorded.
